# hydroponic-baby-monitor

Snippets of code for various pieces of hardware project for monitoring hydroponic plants, including RasPi-controlled camera &amp; growlights, Arduino-controlled water/temp/humidity sensors, and a server (future) for users to access this data.

All only part of the whole project, and none of this will work without the necessary hardware.
